# Tetea Jamii

Tetea Jamii is a community-based organization rooted in the heart of Takaungu, Kilifi County, Kenya, dedicated to transforming lives through justice, empowerment, and sustainability.

Founded with the belief that every individual deserves a fair chance to thrive, Tetea Jamii focuses on building resilient communities by addressing social, economic, and environmental challenges through practical, people-centered solutions.

## Our Story

Tetea Jamii was born out of a shared vision — to create a safe, empowered, and sustainable community where justice and opportunity go hand in hand. Over the years, the organization has become a vital force in gender justice advocacy, youth empowerment, and environmental restoration along Kenya’s coast.

From organizing mangrove planting initiatives that restore ecosystems and create income opportunities, to mentorship programs that give young people safe spaces to learn and grow, Tetea Jamii’s impact continues to ripple across generations.

## Our Work

• Gender Justice and Protection

Tetea Jamii actively combats gender-based violence (GBV) by walking with survivors through their healing journey and ensuring justice is served. Through awareness campaigns, case follow-ups, and community dialogues, the organization fosters a culture of accountability and safety.

• Youth Empowerment Through Sports and Mentorship

Recognizing the rise of child abuse and the lack of safe recreational spaces, Tetea Jamii formed a boys’ football team that promotes teamwork, discipline, and emotional expression. The initiative has become a sanctuary for young men to share their struggles, discover their potential, and embrace positive masculinity. Plans are underway to develop a Talent Hub, which will nurture young talents through training, mentorship, and career pathways.

• Sustainable Livelihoods and Blue Economy

In partnership with organizations like Plan International, Tetea Jamii has led mangrove restoration projects along the Indian Ocean shores in Takaungu. These initiatives not only restore marine ecosystems but also generate income through the sale of mangrove seedlings — empowering both women and men to earn sustainably.

• Women’s Economic Empowerment

Under the leadership of Madam Lilian Wamoi, fondly called “The Woman of Still” for her unyielding persistence, Tetea Jamii supports women in building financial independence. Lilian pioneered a community catering initiative, providing women with skills and opportunities to improve their livelihoods and support their families.

## Vision

A just, sustainable, and empowered society where every individual can live with dignity, purpose, and opportunity.

## Mission

To promote justice, nurture talent, and build sustainable livelihoods through mentorship, advocacy, and community-driven solutions. We are the eyes and the voice of the community.

## Motto

> Empowering Communities, Sustaining Tomorrow.
